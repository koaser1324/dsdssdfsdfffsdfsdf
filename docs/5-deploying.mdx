# Deploying

When all things are set up and working as you expect for the whole project when you run locally, finally, you will need to deploy to production, right?

For this, it's not really such a big work to do at this point, all what you need is:

1. Deploy the `server/` folder to your cloud-based service, there is many options and choosing one of them in your personal choice and up to you

2. After the deployment, you should get the url for your api, as example, let's say after you did deployed the server, you got this api url:

```
https://yourserverlink.com
```

<br />

3. take that url, and simply under both, the `.env` file inside the `/application` and the `env` file inside the `/web_panel` folder, set that url to the `API_URL` environment variable:

```dart title=application/.env
API_URL=https://yourserverlink.com
```

```dart title=web_panel/env
API_URL=https://yourserverlink.com `
```

<br />

4. That's it, now you can build both the admin panel and the application by running `flutter build` on both folders and get the production-ready outputs.
