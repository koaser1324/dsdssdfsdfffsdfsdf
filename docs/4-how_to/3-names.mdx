# Change The App Name

in order to changing the app name, we're going to use the [flutter_launcher_name](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_name) package that simplifies the task of updating the app launcher name for you.

1. From the app project directory, search for the `pubspec.yaml` file
2. Open it, then add the following like this:

```dart title=./application/pubspec.yaml {2,4-5}
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_launcher_name: "^0.0.1"

flutter_launcher_name:
  name: "yourNewAppLauncherName"
```

**Replace `yourNewAppLauncherName` with the your app name**

:::caution Warning
Be careful with spaces, this file is sensitive with spaces, an extra/less space will cause failure in next step

3. Open the cmd (command line), then run this command:

```
flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_name:main
```

4. Then wait so it get the package, and run it to change the app name

5. That's it, now run or build your app and you should see the name changed
