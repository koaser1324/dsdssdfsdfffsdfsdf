# Optional App Configurations

A local configuration file called `config.dart`, contains many configurations (variables) that could be changed in order to customize, configure, change a behavior in the app, every variable includes an explanation of what it does.

## Why it exists inside the project, and not configurable from th Admin Panel ?

The answer is simple : it should be that way.

The configurations inside this file are related directly to the source code of the app, like declaring assets paths, app behaviors..., not configurations that can be loaded throw connections such as enabling ads, share...
