# Creating Admin Credential

## Creation

In order to create a new admin account which you will let you authenticate to access the Admin Panel, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Open the `server/` folder.

2. Open the `.env` file that you've worked with from the [previous section](./1-backend.mdx).

:::note
at this point, the `.env` file should contains already the `MANGODB_URI` and `PORT` variables.
:::

3. Add your desired username and password to authenticate with as environment variables, like this:

```
ADMIN_USERNAME=myUserName
ADMIN_PASSWORD=myPassword
```

4. Now, from the `/server` folder, Run the command `npm run create_admin`.

5. this will create a new admin credential using the `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` information you did put inside the `.env` file.

## Verification

1. If the operation did executed successfully and an account admin is created successfully, your command line console should show this:

```
Admin with username <ADMIN_USERNAME> created successfully
```

:::tip
For Security, after creating the admin account successfully, you can delete the `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from the `.env` since they are only used in order to create the account, after that, those credentials will be saved in the MangoDB database and can be used every time you want to access the Admin Panel.

## When I should Go To Next Step ?

When you [verify](#verification) that the username and password did created successfully, ** congratulations**, you can pass to the next step where you will run the Admin Panel on your browser using those credentials.
