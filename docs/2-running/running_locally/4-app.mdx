Your server url should not end with a `/`:
Invalid: localhost:3000/
Valid: localhost:3000

9. run it by clicking the **run** button in your IDE, and wait until it compile. Alternatively, just run the command `flutter run --debug` from the folder path in a command line tool.

## Verification

1.After the app code get compiled, The app should now be running on your device or emulator in the debug mode, connecting to the API using the URL specified in the .env file.
