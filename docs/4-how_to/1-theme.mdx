# Change the App Theme

We provide a more flexible way to change the theme of the app using a website tool which is [appainter](https://appainter.dev/). This tool allows you to customize various visual elements of the app such as colors, fonts, and more.

Open it, then customize everything as you want. once you have made your changes, you can use it to generate a JSON file of the theme that can be used in the app.

## Using the Theme Generator Tool

1. Visit the theme generator website [appainter](https://appainter.dev/#/)
2. Use the tool's interface to customize the visual elements of the app to your liking.
3. Once you are satisfied with your changes, click the `export` button.
4. Download the generated JSON file of the theme.

## Applying the Generated Theme

1. Copy the downloaded JSON file of the theme to the `assets` folder in the root of your `/application` directory.

2. In the `config.dart` file, change the [`lightThemePath`](../3-configuration/app_config.mdx#lightThemePath) variable to the asset path of your JSON file.

```dart title=./application/lib/config/config.dart
static String lightThemePath = 'assets/YOUR_THEME.json';
```

3. Now re-run the application, and you those changes will be applied automatically.
