# Running Admin Panel

## Installation

1. open the `/web_panel` folder.

2. Open a terminal (cmd or a powershell) inside the path of that opened folder (`/web_panel`).

3. Run the command `flutter pub get` to download the required Flutter dependencies.

4. In that opened directory (`/web_panel`), you should find a `env.example` file containing:

```
API_URL=your_server_url
```

4.1. Replace `your_server_url` with the server url.

:::tip
Following the [`Running Backend Server`](./1-backend.mdx), you should get the server url as `localhost:<Port>`, replace with it.
:::

:::tip
When deploying your app to production, after deploying the server to some cloud-based service, you will need simply to replace it with your production server url.
:::

:::danger
Your server url should not end with a `/`:
Invalid: localhost:3000/
Valid: localhost:3000
:::

5. Replace the `env.example` file name to `env`

:::danger
Pay attention that the final file name should be `env`.
:::

6. Open the `/web_panel` folder, in your IDE (Vscode, or Android Studio..)

7. open the `/lib/main.dart` file. (don't worry, no coding is required)

8. Run it in the browser (Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge), by clicking the **run** button in your IDE, and wait until it compile. Alternatively, just run the command `flutter run --web-browser` from the folder path in a command line tool.

9. wait until the Admin Panel runs.

## Verification:

1. The admin panel should be opened automatically on the browser properly.
2. You can then authenticate with the username and password you did create in the previous guide.

## When I should Go To Next Step ?

When the Admin Panel is opened successfully, you will see the authentication page shown to you, **congratulations**, now you can authenticate/login with the username and password you did created from the [previous step](./2-create_admin.mdx), and then the Admin Panel where you can manage your app will be opened.
